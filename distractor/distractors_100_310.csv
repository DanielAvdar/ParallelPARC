Fire destroys vegetation, reducing the food sources for animals and leading to displacement. Smoke from the fire reduces the oxygen levels in the area, making it difficult for animals to breathe. Additionally, the extreme heat caused by the fire can disrupt the behavior and habitats of animals, making it difficult for them to survive.","Deforestation destroys the natural habitat of animals, reducing the area of land available for them to live in. Logging activities can reduce the food availability for animals, as their natural sources of food may no longer be available.

This is because deforestation which includes logging, must happen first to pave way for logging activities. Therefore, it would be impossible and illogical for logging activities to occur if the deforestation hasn't taken place which includes logging itself. Hence, placing ""logging activities"" before ""deforestation"" results in an illogical sequence of events.","[1] Logging activities reduce the food availability for animals.
