Your task is to concatenate the EVENTS_ORDER according to the temporal order in EVENTS_ORDER which is wrong,
to create illogical paragraph.
Inputs: EVENTS_ORDER
Outputs: OUTPUT_PARAGRAPH

Inputs:
EVENTS_ORDER:
[1]: A cut occurs on your hand.
[2]: A bandage is applied to cover the injury and protect it from further harm.
[3]: The wound is cleaned with antiseptic to help prevent infection.
[4]: The healing process begins and the incision is gradually closed up.

Outputs:
OUTPUT_PARAGRAPH:
[1] When you get a cut on your hand, [2] the first step is to apply a bandage to cover the injury and protect it from further harm.
[3] After a bandage is applied, the next step is to clean the wound with antiseptic to help prevent infection.
[4] As time passes, the healing process begins, in which the incision is gradually closed up.

Inputs:
EVENTS_ORDER:
[1]: Inhaling oxygen through the lungs.
[2]: Capillaries distribute oxygen to the cells.
[3]: Oxygen binds to hemoglobin in the bloodstream.
[4]: Cells use oxygen as a source of energy.

Outputs:
OUTPUT_PARAGRAPH:
[1] When we inhale, our lungs take in oxygen. [2] Then, the capillaries then distribute the oxygen directly to the cells.
[3] Afterward, the oxygen binds to hemoglobin in the bloodstream.
[4] Finally, the cells use oxygen as a source of energy to function effectively.

Inputs:
EVENTS_ORDER:
[1]: The increased pressure can be too much for the boiler to take and if the pressure exceeds the boiler's capacity, it can cause an explosion.
[2]: Steam heats the liquid inside the boiler, causing the pressure to build up.
[3]: As the pressure increases, the steam begins to push against the walls of the boiler.

Outputs:
OUTPUT_PARAGRAPH:
[1] An explosion can occur when the pressure inside a boiler exceeds its capacity due to being unable to handle the increased pressure.
[2] Following the explosion, the boiler begins to heat the liquid inside, resulting in the buildup of steam.
[3] Later, as the steam pressure continues to rise, it pushes against the walls of the boiler, creating an ongoing cycle of pressure buildup.

Inputs:
EVENTS_ORDER:
[1]: Allergens can then trigger a flare-up of the autoimmune disease, leading to a heightened response from the body's immune system.
[2]: An autoimmune disease is caused by an overreaction of the immune system.
[3]: Antigens build up in the body which leads the immune system to produce antibodies, shifting its normal response.

Outputs:
OUTPUT_PARAGRAPH:
[1] Allergens trigger a flare-up of the autoimmune disease, leading to a heightened response from the body's immune system.
[2] Following this response, an autoimmune disease is caused by an overreaction of the immune system.
[3] Subsequently, antigens build up in the body which leads the immune system to produce antibodies, shifting its normal response.

Inputs:
EVENTS_ORDER:
[1]: A heavy snowfall saturates the mountain slope.
[2]: The instability causes the snow to break loose, creating an avalanche.
[3]: The snow accumulates on the steep slopes and becomes increasingly unstable.

Outputs:
OUTPUT_PARAGRAPH:
[1] A heavy snowfall saturates the mountain slope. [2] Then, it causes the snow to break loose, creating an avalanche.
[3] After the avalanche, the snow accumulates on the steep slopes and becomes increasingly unstable.
