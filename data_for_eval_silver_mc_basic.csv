399,413How does a wireless communication system work?,"The human auditory system works by detecting sound waves. The ears pick up sound waves, which are then sent to the cochlea. The cochlea then converts these sound waves into electrical signals. These electrical signals are sent to the auditory nerve, which then transmits them to the brain. This is how we hear sound.","Wind and water erode rocks.
The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks.
Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice.
Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times.

400,666Describe the process of wastewater treatment,"Desalination is the process of removing salt from seawater. The process involves evaporating the seawater, which creates saltwater. The water vapor then condenses and is collected as liquid. The salt is then separated from the water molecules, yielding purified water.","The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery.
They process it with millions of tiny nephrons.
Remove all the waste.
The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery.
Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters.","Adult rabbits mate.
The female becomes pregnant.
The female gives birth to rabbit babies.
The rabbit babies grow into adult rabbits.
The new adults mate with other rabbits.
Produce more rabbits.","Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth's crust.
Magma rises.
Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano.
Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill.
Gain energy for eruption.
Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes).
If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases.
Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense.
If the magma is thin and runs.
The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption.",Wastewater treatment is a process that involves evaporating wastewater in order to produce clean water. The air vapor from the wastewater is then condensed to form precipitation. This precipitation is then passed through a filter which separates the contaminants from the water molecules. The clean water is then collected in a reservoir while the contaminants are discarded.,"[""The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery.\nThey process it with millions of tiny nephrons.\nRemove all the waste.\nThe kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery.\nSend the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters."", ""Adult rabbits mate.\nThe female becomes pregnant.\nThe female gives birth to rabbit babies.\nThe rabbit babies grow into adult rabbits.\nThe new adults mate with other rabbits.\nProduce more rabbits."", ""Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth's crust.\nMagma rises.\nCollects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano.\nPressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill.\nGain energy for eruption.\nSome of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes).\nIf the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases.\nResults in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense.\nIf the magma is thin and runs.\nThe magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption."", ""Wastewater treatment is a process that involves evaporating wastewater in order to produce clean water.

401,874How does electricity get from a power plant to a home?,"Oil is extracted from an underground reservoir, usually through a process of drilling. The oil is then transported through a pipeline to its destination. Once it arrives, the oil is stored in a tank until it is ready to be sold at a gas station. The tank helps to maintain the oil's quality and keeps it at a consistent temperature until it is ready to be used.","Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity.

402,211How does the formation of clouds occur?,"Rain occurs when the sun heats the surface of the earth, which causes the water to evaporate and produces water vapor. The warm air then rises and carries the moisture upward, where it cools and condenses into clouds. The moisture in the clouds increases until the air can no longer support it, and it falls back to the earth as rain.","A seed is planted.

Enters the lungs.
The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs.
Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled.
The oxygen is pass throughout your body.","The formation of clouds begins with condensation, which produces clouds from water droplets. The Sun's energy warms the atmosphere, which causes the air to rise. As the air rises, it carries water droplets up into the atmosphere, where the droplets condense and form clouds.","[""Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone.\nThe sound travels in waves, as sound does.\nThe sound \""bounces\"" off of a nearby object.\nThe sound wave returns to the bat.\nThe bat hears the echoed sound.\nFolds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves.\nOther animals use echolocation in generally similar ways."", ""A seed is planted.\nIt becomes a seedling.\nThe seedling grows into a full-grown plant.\nThe plant releases some kind of pollenating product.\nThe plant either self-pollinates or is spread by insects or birds.\nSeeds are planted.\nThe cycle begins again."", ""The formation of clouds begins with condensation, which produces clouds from water droplets.
