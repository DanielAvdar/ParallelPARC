(ureter, transports, waste) like (stomata, transports, carbon dioxide). (urea, produces, blood) like (glucose, produces, energy)","The liver is responsible for performing a variety of essential functions in the body. The liver works to filter impurities from the blood that the kidneys have not been able to filter. The ureter then transports the waste away from the liver. It also produces urea, which helps to remove waste from the blood. It also plays a role in producing cholesterol and hormones, storing vitamins and minerals, and breaking down fats and carbohydrates.","Photosynthesis is a process that uses the energy from sunlight to create glucose. Chloroplasts are specialized organelles that filter the sunlight and convert it into energy. Stomata, which are tiny pores on the leaves of plants, transport carbon dioxide which is then used to create glucose. This glucose is then used to produce energy for the plant.",,1

(water, evaporates, steam) like (gas, expands, exhaust). (flame, heats, boiling pot) like (combustion, powers, turbine)","When heat is applied to water, it increases the boiling point of the water. As the boiling point is reached, the water begins to evaporate and turn into steam. The most common way to apply heat to the water and bring it to a boil is to use a flame to heat the boiling pot. The heat from the flame then transfers to the water, raising the temperature until the boiling point is reached.","Getting a gas turbine to rotate requires energy to be input into the system. The energy increases the rotation speed of the turbine. The process of combustion powers the turbine, resulting in the expansion of gas through the exhaust. This expansion of gas is what causes the turbine to rotate.",,1

The glass acts as a barrier that prevents the heat from escaping, causing the temperature inside the greenhouse to rise. The sunlight that enters the greenhouse is absorbed by the plants and soil, which helps to keep the interior warm.","When heat enters the body, glass walls form around the body which trap the heat and help the body maintain a steady temperature. The walls act as an insulation, and the body is able to regulate its temperature by controlling the temperature of the glass walls.",,1

(oil, transported by, pipeline) like (mineral, transported by, conveyor belt). (oil, processed at, refinery) like (mineral, processed at, smelter)","Oil is extracted from an underground reservoir using drilling techniques. The oil is then transported through a pipeline to a refinery where it is processed. At the refinery, the oil is separated into different components according to its properties. The oil is then packaged and transported by truck to gas stations, where it is used to fuel cars.","The mineral is extracted from ore and then transported by a conveyor belt. Once it reaches the smelter, the mineral is processed in order to separate it from the other materials. The mineral is then sent to a refinery where it is further processed and refined into a usable product.",,2
