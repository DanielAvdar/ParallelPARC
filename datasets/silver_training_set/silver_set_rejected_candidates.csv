This sunlight is then absorbed by the Earth's surface and is re-emitted as heat. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere traps this heat, causing the temperature to increase at the surface. This increased temperature results in the warming of the atmosphere.","The home air conditioning system works by using a compressor to power the refrigerant. The refrigerant passes through a condenser which cools the air before it is circulated throughout the house. The evaporator then absorbs the moisture from the air and returns it to the compressor in order to start the cycle again. The compressor, condenser and evaporator all work together to provide a comfortable space for people to live in."

(detergent, breaks, dirt) like (polls, assesses, public opinion). (water, circulates, interior) like (campaigns, spreads, information)",A dishwasher is a machine that cleans dishes. It works by using a combination of detergent and water to break down dirt and food particles on the dishes. The water circulates around the interior of the dishwasher and is used in conjunction with the detergent to clean the dishes. The dishwasher then drains the dirty water and returns the dishes to their original clean state.,"A voting system is an important tool for informing decision-making. It allows citizens to express their opinions regarding political issues and candidates. Polls are used to assess public opinion, while campaigns can be used to spread information about candidates and issues. This information is used to influence voter decisions and ultimately determine the outcome of elections."

This warm air creates a low pressure system and causes the air around it to start rotating and spiraling inward. As the air rises, it cools and creates condensation that further fuels the storm system. This condensation releases heat, which warms the air and causes it to continue to rise, further fueling the storm.","The immune response is activated when an antigen is presented to the body. This triggers a defense mechanism to be released in order to protect the body. The presence of humidity increases the condensation of the antigen, which further activates the defense mechanism."
