(oil, transported through, pipeline) like (electricity, transmitted through, power lines). (oil, stored in, tank) like (electricity, stored in, battery)","Oil is extracted from an underground reservoir, usually through a process of drilling. The oil is then transported through a pipeline to its destination. Once it arrives, the oil is stored in a tank until it is ready to be sold at a gas station. The tank helps to maintain the oil's quality and keeps it at a consistent temperature until it is ready to be used.","Electricity is generated from a power plant, typically through the use of a generator. The generated electricity is then transmitted through power lines to the desired location. The electricity then gets stored in a battery, which can be used to power appliances and lights in the home."," Electricity is generated from a power plant. Immediately, the generated electricity is used to power appliances and lights in the home. After being used, the electricity is then stored in a battery. Finally, the stored electricity is transmitted through power lines to the desired location."

(sunlight, heats, surface of the earth) like (sunlight, warms, atmosphere). (rising air, carries, moisture) like (rising air, carries, water droplets)","Rain occurs when the sun heats the surface of the earth, which causes the water to evaporate and produces water vapor. The warm air then rises and carries the moisture upward, where it cools and condenses into clouds. The moisture in the clouds increases until the air can no longer support it, and it falls back to the earth as rain.","The formation of clouds begins with condensation, which produces clouds from water droplets. The Sun's energy warms the atmosphere, which causes the air to rise. As the air rises, it carries water droplets up into the atmosphere, where the droplets condense and form clouds."," The formation of clouds begins with condensation, which forms water droplets. These water droplets then condense and form clouds in the atmosphere. Following this, the Sun's energy warms the atmosphere, causing air to rise. As the air rises, it carries water droplets into the atmosphere."
