This folder includes the files related to the ProPara-Logy dataset (generated by our ParallelPARC pipeline).
* The folder "gold_test_set" includes: "gold_set_analogies.csv" (310 instances of the analogies), <br>
"gold_set_analogies_w_challenging_distractors.csv" (include also the challenging distractors in respect to the analogous target paragraphs), <br> and 
"gold_set_analogies_w_challenging_distractors_w_randoms.csv" (include all the data in the gold-set, by adding also the random target paragraphs) <br> <br>
* The folder "silver_training_set" includes similar files, but for the silver-set which is automatically generated.
* The folder "propara" includes files related to the ProPara training set. <br>
* In addition, we have the files "gold_set_candidates_for_further_inspection.csv" and "silver_set_candidates_for_further_inspection.csv". <br> They include
the analogy candidates for further inspection. See Section 4 in the paper for details. <br>
* We also include the annotators disagreements "gold_set_annotators_disagreements.csv" and predicted annotators disagreements candidates in "silver_set_annotators_disagreements.csv".
