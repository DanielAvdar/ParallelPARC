This folder includes the files related to the ProParaLogy dataset (generated by our ParallelPARC pipeline).
* The folder "gold_test_set" includes: "gold_set_analogies.csv" (310 instances of the analogies),
"gold_set_analogies_w_challenging_distractors.csv" (include also the challenging distractors in respect to the analogous target paragraphs), and 
"gold_set_analogies_w_challenging_distractors_w_randoms.csv" (include all the data in the gold-set, by adding also the random target paragraphs)
* The folder "silver_training_set" includes similar files, but for the silver-set which is automatically generated.
* The folder "propara" includes files related to the ProPara training set.
* In addition, we have the files "gold_set_candidates_for_further_inspection.csv" and "silver_set_candidates_for_further_inspection.csv". They include
the analogy candidates for further inspection (for the gold and silver sets). See Section 3.6 in the paper.
* We also include the annotators disagreements "gold_set_annotators_disagreements.csv" and predicted annotators disagreements candidates in "silver_set_annotators_disagreements.csv".
