 The field then interacts with the body's cells, which allows the body to control its blood sugar level.","When the immune system is exposed to a pathogen, it responds by creating antibodies.
 These antibodies are produced by lymphocytes which also produce cytokines that help to regulate the immune response.
 The presence of antigens on the pathogen amplifies the immune response, triggering the production of more antibodies to fight off the infection.",close analogy,2.0

 The ear receives sound waves, which cause the eardrum to vibrate.
 These sound vibrations then travel to the cochlea, which processes the sound signals and sends them to the brain.
 The cochlea is responsible for translating the sound signals into meaningful information that the brain can understand.","A sound system starts with a microphone that receives sound waves.
 The microphone converts the sound waves into electrical signals.
 These signals are then processed and amplified by an amplifier.
 The amplifier increases the strength of the sound signal before sending it to the loudspeaker.
 The loudspeaker then vibrates to produce sound vibrations that are heard by the listener.",close analogy,2.0
