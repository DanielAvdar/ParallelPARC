(sunlight, encourages, growth) like (light, encourages, germination). (seeds, planted, in rows) like (seeds, sowed, in pots)","Planting crops involves a process of preparing the soil and planting the seeds. The soil must be tilled and enriched with nutrients to provide a good base for the crops to grow. Sunlight is also needed to encourage growth, so the seeds must be planted in an area that receives enough sunlight. The seeds should be planted in rows for easier maintenance and harvesting.","Germinating seeds is a process in which the seeds absorb moisture from the soil and begin to grow. The soil should be kept moist and the seeds should be sowed in pots. Additionally, light encourages the germination process. Once the seed has absorbed enough moisture, it will begin to sprout, and the growth process will begin.",,,,,,0,2

(oxygen, is absorbed, alveoli) like (resources, are utilized, market). (waste, is expelled, bronchi) like (profit, is generated, businesses)","When we breathe, air enters the lungs. The air passes through the bronchi, which are the tubes that lead to the alveoli. The alveoli are tiny air sacs that are responsible for absorbing oxygen from the air. The oxygen is then transported to the rest of the body. At the same time, the alveoli also expel waste gases such as carbon dioxide through the bronchi, resulting in the exhalation of air.","Money enters the economy through investments and earnings. This money is then utilized by the market to purchase resources such as labor and materials. Businesses use these resources to produce products and services, which are then sold for a profit. This profit is then reinvested in the economy, resulting in a cycle of economic growth and stability.",,,,,,1,0

(Exhaust, releases, carbon dioxide) like (Acid rain, releases, sulfuric acid). (Smog, reduces, visibility) like (Acid rain, erodes, buildings)","Pollutants such as exhaust from vehicles and factories contaminate the air and can cause a variety of bad effects on the environment. Exhaust releases carbon dioxide, which can contribute to global warming. Smog is formed when pollutants mix with air and sunlight, reducing visibility and leading to health problems.","Acid rain is a form of precipitation that is created when sulfuric acid and other pollutants mix with the water in the atmosphere. This acidic water is then released back down to the earth, where it can corrode soil, erode buildings and damage the environment. The sulfuric acid released by acid rain can cause the soil to become more acidic, which can be harmful to plants and animals. Additionally, the acid rain can damage buildings, statues and other structures due to the corrosive effect of the acid.",,,,,,2,1
