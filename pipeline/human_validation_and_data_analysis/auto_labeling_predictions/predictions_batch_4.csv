Bees can help pollinate flowers, enabling the plants to produce more seeds.","Robots use drones to help deliver packages by having the drones carry the packages to the destination. Once the package is delivered, the robots disperse the packages to their respective locations. In some cases, robots are even used to pollinate parcels, which helps minimize delivery time.",,,,,,273,1

During the process, alpha particles are emitted from the radioactive nuclei. The decay of the radioactive nuclei occurs over a certain time frame.","Atoms combine to form molecules by exchanging electrons to form bonds. This process, known as covalent bond formation, occurs in a short time frame. During a reaction, the bonds that form between atoms can break, allowing the atoms to rearrange and form new bonds.

During mitosis, the chromosomes inside the cell duplicate. This results in two identical sets of chromosomes, known as chromatids, being formed in the nucleus. The chromatids then separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. Finally, the daughter cells divide, and each cell receives one set of chromatids.","Meiosis is a process that involves the cell replicating its chromosomes. The replicated chromosomes are then distributed to daughter cells, which separate from the nucleus. The replicated chromosomes, also known as chromatids, then divide at opposite poles. This process is repeated to create four haploid daughter cells from the original diploid cell.",,,,,,275,3

When the fault lines rupture, it causes the surface to move and creates seismic waves that travel through the ground. These seismic waves are what cause the ground to shake, resulting in an earthquake.","Political conflicts often occur when political ideologies shift in alignment. As these ideologies clash, cultural beliefs can rupture the unity of a nation. Ideas travel through society, creating divides between different groups with conflicting beliefs. This can cause tensions to arise, leading to a political conflict.",,,,,,278,1

The eggs then hatch into tadpoles, which start the development process that eventually leads to the formation of an adult frog. As the tadpole grows, its tail gradually disappears and it develops legs and lungs. Eventually, the tadpole will transform into an adult frog that is fully capable of living on land. The adult frog then releases eggs of its own, completing the life cycle.","The life cycle of an aircraft begins with the assembly of the fuselage. This is done by connecting the different parts of the plane, such as the wings and tail, to the main body. The engine is then developed to create the necessary thrust for flight. The aircraft is then tested and any necessary modifications are made to ensure that it can reach the desired flight speed. Finally, the aircraft takes off and releases fuel as it progresses through its journey.",,,,,,279,0

The magma is composed of molten rock, gas, and crystals and is ejected from the volcano. As the magma cools, it hardens into lava and forms new land. Once cooled, the lava is solid and can no longer flow, creating new landforms.","An allergic reaction occurs when an antigen triggers an immune response from the body. In response, histamines are released in the bloodstream which cause the body to recognize the antigen as a threat. This causes inflammation in the affected area and the body begins to produce antibodies to fight off the antigen. The release of histamines causes the symptoms of an allergy such as swelling, itching, and hives.",,,,,,281,0

As the moisture accumulates, the atmospheric pressure changes and the wind direction shifts, forming thunderclouds known as cumulonimbus. From there, the storm continues to grow and build in intensity until it eventually dissipates.","A hurricane begins to form when moisture and humidity accumulate in a large area of warm heat. As the temperature of the air rises, the warm air begins to move in an upward direction. This causes the formation of an area of low pressure and the warm air begins to move in a circular motion. As the storm strengthens, an eye wall begins to form around the hurricane eye. The eye wall is the area of the storm with the strongest winds and heaviest rain.",,,,,,283,2
