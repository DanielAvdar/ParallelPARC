The transported pieces are then exposed to extreme temperatures and pressures, which cause them to transform into new types of rocks.","The hydrological cycle is the cycle of water exchange between the atmosphere, land, and ocean. Precipitation is one of its components, and it involves the breakdown of minerals as they fall to the Earth. Heat coming from the Earth's core also produces magma, which then forms clouds that eventually release the water in the form of rain or snow.",,,,,,1212,1

(condensation, forms, clouds) like (phagocytes, forms, immune cells). (precipitation, produces, rain) like (inflammation, produces, cytokines)","Rain is created through an ongoing cycle of evaporation and condensation. Evaporation releases water vapor, which rises into the atmosphere. The water vapor then condenses and forms clouds. Eventually, the clouds become too heavy and precipitation is produced, resulting in rain.","When an antigen is introduced into the body, the immune system releases antibodies that bind to the antigen in order to neutralize it. In addition, phagocytes form immune cells to engulf and digest the antigen. The response to the antigen also produces inflammation, which signals the release of cytokines to alert other immune cells to the presence of the pathogen.",,,,,,1213,0

(water, freeze, at a certain temperature) like (refrigerant, evaporate, at a certain pressure). (cold air, circulate, around the room) like (refrigerant, circulate, through the system)",Ice cubes are formed in the freezer when the temperature of the water drops below a certain point and it begins to freeze. Cold air is circulated around the interior of the freezer to keep the temperature at a low enough level for the water to freeze. The cold air helps to ensure that the ice cubes form properly and quickly.,"A refrigeration system is designed to cool down a room by releasing cold air into the space.  The system works by circulating the refrigerant through the system, causing it to evaporate at a certain pressure.  This evaporation of refrigerant creates a cooling effect, which is then released into the room.  The air in the room is then cooled, allowing the room to reach a comfortable temperature.",,,,,,1214,2

This happens when the temperature drops below the freezing point. The air around us also contains floating particles, such as dust, which provide a surface for water droplets to freeze onto. When these water droplets freeze, they create tiny ice crystals, which then join together to form snowflakes.","The formation of a virus occurs when genetic material from different sources combine together to form a new virus. The conditions must become favorable for the virus to form, and once the environment contains the virus, it will spread. The genetic material from different sources is essential for the virus to form and for the virus to spread in the environment.",,,,,,1215,0

(owls, detect, prey) like (bats, detect, prey). (owls, locate, prey) like (bats, locate, prey)",Owls are able to hunt at night by using sound waves. They use their specialized facial disc to send out sound waves and detect the prey. The sound waves bounce off the objects and owls are able to locate the prey by interpreting the echoes. The owls also have an incredible sense of hearing which enables them to hone in on the prey.,"Bats use a special technique called echolocation to hunt in the dark. They emit high-frequency sound waves and detect the echoes that bounce off of nearby objects, which helps them locate their prey. The echoes allow the bats to detect the size, shape, and distance of the prey so they can locate it quickly and accurately.",,,,,,1216,3

The eggs will then hatch into tadpoles, which are small and fish-like. Over time, the tadpoles will develop into frogs with legs, lungs and other characteristics of frogs. Finally, the frogs will spawn eggs and the cycle begins again.","The growth cycle of an economy is fueled by investment, which leads to a steady increase in GDP. As consumption increases, market share expands and businesses increase production. This in turn creates more jobs and brings more money into the economy.
