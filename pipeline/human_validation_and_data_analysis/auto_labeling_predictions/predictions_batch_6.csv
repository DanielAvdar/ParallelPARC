(juveniles, mature, adults) like (virus particles, spread, new hosts). (adults, spawn, eggs) like (viruses, infect, new hosts)","The life cycle of a bird begins with the egg. The egg hatches into a larvae, which then matures into a juvenile. At this point, the bird begins to look like an adult, but has not yet reached full maturity. As the juvenile matures into an adult, it grows feathers and is able to fly. Adults then spawn eggs which start the cycle anew.","The development of a virus begins when the host cell replicates the virus particles. These virus particles then spread to new hosts, where they can infect the new hosts with the virus. Once the virus particles have entered the new hosts, they can begin replicating and spreading to other hosts, thus perpetuating the cycle.",,,,,,929,0

The oil provides energy to the boiler, which is then transferred to the radiators and other heating elements in the house. The thermostat regulates the temperature in the house by controlling the flow of hot air. The oil is consumed as the heat is used to warm the house and the process starts over again when the temperature drops.","A government policy can have a significant influence on public opinion. Laws provide guidance to citizens on what they can and cannot do, and these laws can shape public opinion on certain issues. Additionally, the media can regulate the information that is shared, which can also affect public opinion. By understanding how a policy affects public opinion, governments can take steps to ensure that the public is informed and engaged in the policymaking process.",,,,,,930,0

The water is transported from the roots to the other parts of the plant by the xylem. The stomata on the leaves of the plant are responsible for taking in CO2 and releasing oxygen and water vapor. The process of transpiration also plays an important role in the uptake of water by the plant. Water evaporates through the stomata and moves up the plant, allowing it to be used by other parts of the plant.","The lungs absorb oxygen from the air and transport it to the red blood cells. The red blood cells take in the oxygen and then transport it throughout the body. The oxygen is transported through the body by hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen molecules and carries them to the cells. The cells use the oxygen to produce energy and carry out their functions.",,,,,,931,2
