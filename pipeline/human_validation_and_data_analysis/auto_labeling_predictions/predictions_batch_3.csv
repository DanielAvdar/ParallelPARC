They emit sound waves which then travel through the air and bounce off of surrounding objects. The sound waves that are reflected back to the bat are detected and interpreted by the bat as echoes. These echoes are used by bats to detect obstacles around them and to locate prey. The sound waves that bats use for echolocation are usually in the form of ultrasound, which are sound waves of a frequency too high for humans to hear. Ultrasound waves are particularly effective in reflecting off of objects, allowing bats to accurately detect and identify their environment.","Plants emit light as part of the photosynthesis process. The process is able to detect the sunlight and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into energy. The light from the plants is then able to reflect off of surfaces, allowing the plants to absorb more energy.",,,,,,119,1

Next, the seeds are planted and covered with soil. The seeds then absorb the water from the soil, which helps them to germinate. Once the crops have grown enough, they are harvested for consumption.",The germination process begins with spores absorbing moisture. This moisture triggers the seeds to begin to sprout and grow a root system. The root system then grows and absorbs more moisture and nutrients from the soil. The seed then develops leaves and continues to grow until it reaches maturity.,,,,,,120,2

(fault lines, create, seismic waves) like (piers, provide, stability). (tremors, cause, destruction) like (beams, resist, bending)","Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates against each other, which releases energy in the form of seismic waves. Fault lines, which are cracks in the Earth's crust, create these seismic waves that travel through the ground and cause tremors. These tremors can cause large amounts of destruction depending on the intensity of the earthquake.","A bridge is designed to support the weight of vehicles. Girders provide the main support to the bridge and they bear the load of the vehicles that cross it. The stability of the bridge is provided by the piers, which distribute the load and keep the bridge in place. Beams create a rigid structure that resists bending, which allows the bridge to support the weight of the vehicles.",,,,,,121,0

(start, light, fire) like (start, initiate, light reaction)","Typical steps involved in camping include gathering and procuring all the necessary camping equipment. After that, assembling and setting up the tent is important. Then you have to find and locate a campsite. Finally, you can start to light a fire and enjoy your time outdoors.","The typical steps involved in photosynthesis start with gathering and absorbing sunlight. Chloroplasts are then assembled and constructed in order to find and identify the leaf. Once the leaf is found, the light reaction is initiated and the process of photosynthesis begins.",,,,,,122,1

The juice is then fermented, which converts the natural sugars of the grapes into alcohol. During the fermentation process, the sugar in the grapes is transformed into alcohol.","Political decisions are made by transforming opinions into policies. Much like yeast converts sugar into alcohol, opinions are converted into policies through discussion and debate. This process of transformation helps to create and shape the political landscape.",,,,,,123,1
