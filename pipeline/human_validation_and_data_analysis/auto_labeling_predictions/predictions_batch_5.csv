The lungs inhale oxygen from the air and the diaphragm contracts and moves downwards, expanding the chest cavity. Oxygen then passes through the alveoli in the lungs and into the bloodstream. The oxygen is then transported to cells around the body. The diaphragm relaxes, moving upwards, and the lungs exhale carbon dioxide.","Combustion is the process by which fuel is consumed in order to produce heat and energy. An igniter is used to ignite the fuel, which begins the combustion process. The heat produced by the combustion is then transferred to the combustion chamber where it is used to power engines or other machinery.",,,,,,551,0

This waste is then filtered out by the kidneys, which remove the toxins from the blood. The lungs are then responsible for expelling the carbon dioxide from the body. Blood is therefore essential for the removal of waste from the human body.","Gossip often transports information through a small community. People within the community will filter and spread rumors, which can then be spread to other people. This can be done through word of mouth or through the media, which expels news quickly. Gossip is a powerful tool that can be used to spread information quickly in a small community.",,,,,,552,1

(pancreas, secretes, hormones) like (immune system, releases, cytokines). (pancreas, regulates, glucose levels) like (immune system, regulates, inflammatory response)","The pancreas is a gland in the body that produces hormones and insulin. It secretes these hormones and insulin into the bloodstream in order to regulate glucose levels. Insulin helps cells to absorb glucose from the bloodstream. Hormones produced by the pancreas affect the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in the body. The pancreas is responsible for maintaining proper glucose levels in the body by regulating the production and release of hormones and insulin.","The immune system is a complex response that produces antibodies to fight off foreign invaders. When the immune system identifies a foreign invader, it releases cytokines which signal the body to begin the process of producing antibodies. These antibodies help to eliminate the foreign invader. Additionally, the immune system also regulates the inflammatory response to ensure that the body is not harmed by the immune response.",,,,,,553,1

Over time, sediment accumulates and is pushed up. Earthquakes can cause uplift, which further increases the height of the mountains. This process is repeated until the mountains reach their current height.","Societal norms often collide with cultural norms and this can lead to a shift in social attitudes over time. As people accumulate experiences, their attitudes towards certain subjects can change. Additionally, influential events can also cause a shift in attitudes as people are exposed to new ideas or situations.",,,,,,554,2

During hibernation, the body temperature of the animal drops below normal and the heart rate slows considerably. The breathing rate decreases significantly and the animal enters a state of torpor. This helps them survive the cold winter months with minimal energy expenditure.","When a computer system needs to be cooled, the processor temperature will drop below its normal operating temperature. To prevent the processor from overheating, the clock rate of the processor will slow considerably. As a result, the power consumption of the processor will also decrease significantly.",,,,,,555,3

Rain evaporates from the ocean and rises into the atmosphere. As the air cools, condensation forms clouds. The clouds become too heavy and the condensed water droplets become precipitation that falls to the ground. The precipitation then forms rivers, lakes, and streams, which flow back to the ocean, completing the cycle.","The process of voting begins with campaigning, which is the act of influencing potential voters.

The stomach absorbs the nutrients and vitamins from the food and sends them to the rest of the body to be used for energy and growth.,"The digestive system is responsible for breaking down nutrients into smaller parts. It secretes various enzymes that help break down food into smaller substances that can be absorbed by the body. These substances can be used for energy or converted into vitamins and minerals that are absorbed by the body.
