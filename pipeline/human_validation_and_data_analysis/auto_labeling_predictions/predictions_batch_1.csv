The adult fish then spawns eggs which repeat the cycle.",A virus is composed of a viral particle which consists of genetic material surrounded by a protein shell. The viral particle replicates itself by using the host cell's machinery to create progeny. These progeny can then mutate to give rise to different variants of the virus which can then go on to infect other host cells.,,,,,57,1

(sulfur dioxide, reacts with, oxygen) like (greenhouse gases, absorbs, heat). (acid rain, forms, when sulfur dioxide combines with water) like (global warming, increases, when greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere)","Coal is a fossil fuel that is burned to create energy. When it is burned, it emits sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. The sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere and forms sulfuric acid. When sulfuric acid combines with water, it forms acid rain. Therefore, coal contributes to the formation of acid rain.","Air pollution is a major contributor to global warming because it emits pollutants into the atmosphere, which include greenhouse gases. These gases absorb heat from the sun, causing the Earth's surface temperature to rise. When greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere, it leads to a phenomenon known as global warming, which further increases the Earth's temperature.",,,,,58,2
