(oxygen, absorbed, blood) like (antibodies, produced, bloodstream). (carbon dioxide, exhaled, atmosphere) like (white blood cells, fight, pathogens)","The lungs allow air to enter the body. When the air is inhaled, oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream. The oxygen then travels through the bloodstream to the organs and tissues of the body. As the oxygen is used by the body, carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the lungs into the atmosphere.","When antigens enter the body, the immune system is triggered and antibodies are produced and released into the bloodstream. The antibodies are specific to the antigens and are designed to bind to them in order to stop them from entering the body's cells. The white blood cells then help to fight off the pathogens, which are foreign bodies that can cause disease.",,,,,,1498,0

(greenhouse gases, trap, heat) like (pollutants, trap, cells). (methane, accelerates, global warming) like (chemicals, accelerates, diseases)","Greenhouse gases form when carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping, which in turn accelerates global warming. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, as it is able to trap more heat than carbon dioxide and thus quicken global warming.","Pollution is the release of toxins into the environment. These pollutants can enter our bodies through the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. They can even trap our cells and lead to a variety of health issues. Exposure to certain chemicals can accelerate the onset of diseases like cancer, asthma, and heart disease. Therefore, pollution can have a serious impact on human health.",,,,,,1499,1
