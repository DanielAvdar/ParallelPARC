21,295,1073How does the human heartbeat occur?,"Thunderclouds accumulate an electrical charge as the air inside them rises and falls.
 The accumulation of electrical charge creates an imbalance in the electrical field and electricity travels between the clouds and the ground to restore balance.
 This discharge of electricity is what we know as lightning, and is the result of the buildup of electrical charge.","A large rocky area is formed.
The rocky area has a higher elevation than the surrounding areas.

Following this, the electrical impulse is generated when the heart muscles contract. Subsequently, the human heart accumulates an electrical impulse. Then, the heart cells send electricity and travel between each other. Finally, this process of electricity travelling between cells is what causes the heartbeat.","The human heart accumulates an electrical impulse.

22,181,565How does photosynthesis work?,"A steam engine works by using the heat energy produced by a boiler to power a piston.
 The steam produced by the boiler is pumped into a cylinder.
 The pressure of the steam is regulated by a valve and is used to move the piston.
 The heat energy is converted into mechanical energy as the piston moves up and down, creating a power stroke.","Skin is cut or damaged.
Bacteria enters through the wound.
The bacteria reproduces and spreads.
Causes symptoms.
The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease."," When the skin is cut or damaged, the bacteria immediately starts to reproduce and spread. After the bacteria has already reproduced and spread, it then enters through the wound. This causes symptoms to appear. Finally, the bacteria is either fought off by the body's immune system or it becomes a disease."," The chlorophyll absorbs light energy used to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. Then, chloroplasts in plants contain chlorophyll to convert this light energy into usable energy. After this, plants begin the photosynthesis process. Finally, stomata in the leaf regulate the rate of water vapor released from the plant.","Photosynthesis is the process by which plants produce oxygen.

23,12,22How do glaciers shape the landscape?,"Valleys are formed through a combination of natural forces. Rainfall erodes the rock surfaces, gradually wearing them away. A river then carves out a valley as it flows through the land. Earthquakes can also shift landmasses and further shape the valley.","A plant produces a fruit with seeds in it.
