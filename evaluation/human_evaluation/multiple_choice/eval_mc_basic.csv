From the stem, the water travels up to the leaves. In the leaves, the water is used in photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. The water is used to create organic molecules such as sugars, which are used as fuel for the plant.","The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery.
They process it with millions of tiny nephrons.
Remove all the waste.
The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery.

Sweat glands in the skin receive the message.
The sweat glands start combining water and chemicals to make sweat.
The sweat leaves the skin through pores.","Human beings obtain nutrients from the food that they eat.
 The intestines absorb the nutrients from the food and transports them to the blood.
 The blood circulates the nutrients throughout the body and transports them to the cells, where they can be metabolized and used to provide energy.","[""The body's temperature increases over 98.6 degrees F.\nThe hypothalamus in the brain sends a message to the body.\nSweat glands in the skin receive the message.\nThe sweat glands start combining water and chemicals to make sweat.\nThe sweat leaves the skin through pores."", ""Two birds meet each other.\nEgg is produced after fertilziation.\nMother sits on egg until it hatches.\nBird Hatches.\nGrows up.\nFlee the next.\nStarts family.\nDies."", ""Human beings obtain nutrients from the food that they eat.\n The intestines absorb the nutrients from the food and transports them to the blood.\n The blood circulates the nutrients throughout the body and transports them to the cells, where they can be metabolized and used to provide energy."", ""The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery.\nThey process it with millions of tiny nephrons.\nRemove all the waste.\nThe kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery.\nSend the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters.""]",far analogy,C3,"The body's temperature increases over 98.6 degrees F.

33,50How do crystals form?,"Minerals form when molten rock cools and solidifies. The molten rock contains various minerals in its liquid state. As the molten rock cools, pressure causes the minerals to form solid crystals. The temperature at which the molten rock cools also affects what type of minerals form.","A star forms.
The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star.
The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen.
The star becomes a red giant.
A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star.
The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula.
The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star.","A person eats food.
The person's blood sugar level rises.
The pancreas receives a signal to release insulin.
Insulin is released into the bloodstream.
Insulin signals cells to absorb sugar.
The cells absorb sugar from the bloodstream.
The cells use the sugar as energy.","Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.).
Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere.
The make-up of the atmosphere changes.
Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere.
The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy.
Human beings cut down trees.
Human beings do not re-plant the trees.
Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth's short term weather.
Eventually the long-term climate patterns start to change.","Crystals can form in a liquid when the pressure increases. This pressure causes the liquid to become saturated with crystals, which then bond together to form larger crystals. Temperature also plays an important role in crystal formation, as it affects the rate at which crystals can form and grow.","[""A person eats food.\nThe person's blood sugar level rises.\nThe pancreas receives a signal to release insulin.\nInsulin is released into the bloodstream.\nInsulin signals cells to absorb sugar.\nThe cells absorb sugar from the bloodstream.\nThe cells use the sugar as energy."", ""Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.).\nCarbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere.\nThe make-up of the atmosphere changes.\nSome energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere.\nThe earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy.\nHuman beings cut down trees.\nHuman beings do not re-plant the trees.\nTrees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nThe extra trapped energy starts to change the earth's short term weather.\nEventually the long-term climate patterns start to change."", ""A star forms.\nThe star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star.\nThe star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen.\nThe star becomes a red giant.\nA mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star.\nThe star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula.\nThe star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star."", ""Crystals can form in a liquid when the pressure increases.

49,112How does a solar cell convert light energy into electrical energy?,"During photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, which is used to break down water and carbon dioxide molecules.
 The energy from the sunlight is used to react the carbon dioxide with the water and produce glucose.
 The process also releases oxygen as a byproduct.","You inhale.
Your diaphragm moves down.
Your lungs have more room.
Your lungs fill with air.
You exhale.
Your diaphragm moves back up.
Carbon dioxide is exhaled.
You start the process over again.","Begin the party.
Partake in activities.
Bring out the cake.

Water levels of a river or lake get higher.
Water builds up on the ground.
Water covers streets.
Water gets deep in some places.
Water goes into houses and other buildings.
The rain stops or the dam is repaired.
Water flows into streams.
The rest of the floodwater evaporates.","A solar cell is composed of a semiconductor material that absorbs light energy.
 When the light energy is absorbed, the electrons of the semiconductor react with the electric field and become energized.
 The energized electrons then flow through the cell, producing an electric current that can be used to produce energy.","[""Begin the party.\nPartake in activities.\nBring out the cake.\nSing \""Happy Birthday!\"".\nBlow out the candles.\nEat the cake.\nOpen the presents."", ""There is a lot of rain or a dam breaks.\nWater levels of a river or lake get higher.\nWater builds up on the ground.\nWater covers streets.\nWater gets deep in some places.\nWater goes into houses and other buildings.\nThe rain stops or the dam is repaired.\nWater flows into streams.\nThe rest of the floodwater evaporates."", ""A solar cell is composed of a semiconductor material that absorbs light energy.\n When the light energy is absorbed, the electrons of the semiconductor react with the electric field and become energized.\n The energized electrons then flow through the cell, producing an electric current that can be used to produce energy."", ""You inhale.\nYour diaphragm moves down.\nYour lungs have more room.\nYour lungs fill with air.\nYou exhale.\nYour diaphragm moves back up.\nCarbon dioxide is exhaled.\nYou start the process over again.""]",far analogy,C3,"Begin the party.
