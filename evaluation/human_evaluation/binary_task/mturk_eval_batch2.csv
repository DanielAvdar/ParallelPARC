  This energy is then used to produce nutrients for the plant, which are then distributed throughout the plant.",far analogy,1
468Describe the process of filtration,"Desalination is the process of removing salt from water. This is usually done with seawater. The seawater is passed through a membrane, which allows the water molecules to move through but not the salt molecules. Pressure is then used to force the water through the membrane, leaving behind the salt. This process produces freshwater that can be used for various purposes.","Filtration is a process used to remove particles from a liquid.
  The liquid is passed through a filter, which has a mesh size that is small enough to catch the particles.
  Pressure is then used to force the liquid through the filter, trapping the particles on the surface. The filtered liquid is then collected and the particles are discarded.",close analogy,1
743How do robots pollinate crops?,"Bees play a crucial role in pollinating plants.
  They collect pollen from the stamens of flowers and then fly to another flower to transfer the pollen grains.

  The sound waves bounce off the objects and owls are able to locate the prey by interpreting the echoes. The owls also have an incredible sense of hearing which enables them to hone in on the prey.","Bats use a special technique called echolocation to hunt in the dark. The echoes allow the bats to detect the size, shape, and distance of the prey so they can locate it quickly and accurately. After detecting their prey, they emit high-frequency sound waves and detect the echoes that bounce off of nearby objects, which helps them locate their prey.",distractor,0

7What causes a boiler to explode?,"When magma heats up underground water, pressure begins to build up inside the volcano.
  This pressure forces the magma to push against the walls of the volcano, leading to an eruption. The eruption is caused by the pressure of the magma against the walls of the volcano, as well as the heat of the magma heating up the underground water.","Steam heats the liquid inside the boiler, causing the pressure to build up.
