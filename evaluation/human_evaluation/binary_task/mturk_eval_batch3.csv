157,325,393How does a government policy influence public opinion?,"A coal-powered power station generates electricity by burning coal to produce heat.
  The heat produced from burning coal is used to convert thermal energy into electrical energy.
  This electrical energy is then used to power an electric generator which produces electricity.
  The generator uses the electrical energy to generate a magnetic field which causes electrons to move and generate an electric current.
  This electric current is then directed to the power station's output to produce electricity.","Government policy produces an impact on public opinion.

75,579,1128Describe the process by which a tornado forms.,"The process by which hurricanes form begins with rising air which forms low pressure. Warm air rises to higher altitudes while cold air sinks to lower altitudes. This creates a situation where the warm air is surrounded by cold air, which causes the winds to rotate around the low pressure. This rotation of winds is what we know as a hurricane.","A tornado forms when warm air rises to higher altitudes and cold air sinks to lower altitudes. This creates a low pressure area, and the pressure difference causes the air to rise rapidly. This rising air forms a low pressure area, which causes winds to rotate around the low pressure in a counter-clockwise direction due to the Coriolis effect. As the winds rotate, they pick up speed and create a swirling motion, forming a tornado.",close analogy,1,1128
