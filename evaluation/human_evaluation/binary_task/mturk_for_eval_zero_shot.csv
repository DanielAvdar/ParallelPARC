72,424How does water get from the underground aquifer to a reservoir?,"Oil is extracted from underground reservoirs by drilling. The drill penetrates the rock to reach the oil trapped beneath the surface. This oil is then transported through a pipeline to a refinery or gas station. At the refinery, the oil is processed and refined before it is sent on to the gas station for consumers to purchase.","Water is extracted from the underground aquifer using wells that penetrate the soil.
  The water is then transported from the aquifer to the reservoir with a conduit.
  The conduit is designed to move the water from the aquifer to the reservoir, allowing it to be collected and stored.",far analogy,1,53.0,104.0,424.0
73,1143Describe how climate change can negatively affect animals,"Forest fires can have a detrimental impact on the environment and the animals that inhabit it. When a forest fire burns, it emits smoke that can cause air pollution and limit visibility for animals. Additionally, a forest fire can destroy the habitat of animals, leaving them without a safe place to take refuge.","Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, animals find it difficult to survive because of habitat destruction and air pollution. Following this, climate change occurs due to the emission of greenhouse gases. Finally, animals' habitats are destroyed and air pollution increases, further exacerbating the situation.",distractor,0,82.0,644.0,1143.0
74,701Describe the process of global warming,"The greenhouse effect is a process in which the Sun emits infrared radiation, which is then absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. This absorbed radiation then causes the Earth to become warmer. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere traps the heat, creating a barrier that prevents the heat from escaping. Additionally, the ozone layer in the atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet radiation, further contributing to the greenhouse effect.","The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin.
 The aluminum is collected.
 Taken to a treatment plant.
 The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing.
 The aluminum is re-melted.
 Turned into molten aluminum.
 The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots.
 The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out.
 The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products.",random,0,149.0,512.0,701.0
75,925How does an artificial lung work?,"The primary function of the lungs is to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. 
  The lungs absorb oxygen from the air and expel carbon dioxide. 
  This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is important for our bodies to maintain a healthy balance.","An owl leaves his nest.
 The owl flys out into the night.
 The owl looks down at the ground.
