 Glaciers erode rock surfaces and carve out valleys. Tectonic plate shifts then cause landmasses to move, altering the landscape. After the landscape has been altered, glaciers move sediment from one location to another, shaping the land. Finally, glaciers and tectonic plate shifts together create dramatic changes in the landscape, even though the land has already been shaped by the previous events.

C4:
Glaciers are powerful forces of nature that shape the landscape in a variety of ways. Ice erodes rock surfaces and carves out valleys. Glaciers also move sediment from one location to another, which helps to shape the land. Additionally, tectonic plate shifts can cause landmasses to move, which can further alter the landscape. Together, glaciers and tectonic plate shifts can create dramatic changes in the landscape.",ANSWER: C3

B:
An earthquake is caused by the shifting of tectonic plates that make up the Earth's crust.
  When these plates move, they can create a fault line that releases energy in the form of seismic waves that radiate through the Earth.
  These seismic waves can be felt across a large area, causing the ground to shake and tremble.

Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades.
The shaft of the turbine spins.
Shaft is connected to a generator.
The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor.
The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside.
The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity.

MRNA is made during the first step of protein synthesis, which is transcription.
The DNA's genetic information, or secret code, gets written onto a strand of mRNA.
Transcription takes place in the nucleus.

B:
Caverns form when water erodes the rock, causing pressure to build up, leading to the collapse of the rock. Underground rivers can also carve out a cave by cutting through the rock. In addition, groundwater can dissolve limestone, which contributes to the formation of caverns.

C1:
 A drill erodes the soil. Afterward, chemicals are used to dissolve the concrete for a smoother wall surface. Finally, a machine carves out the tunnel, even though the wall surface has already been smoothened.

C2:
Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand.
Over time, more sediment piles on top.
The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen.
Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack.
The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas.

 Glaciers erode rock surfaces and carve out valleys. Tectonic plate shifts then cause landmasses to move, altering the landscape. After the landscape has been altered, glaciers move sediment from one location to another, shaping the land. Finally, glaciers and tectonic plate shifts together create dramatic changes in the landscape, even though the land has already been shaped by the previous events.

C4:
Glaciers are powerful forces of nature that shape the landscape in a variety of ways. Ice erodes rock surfaces and carves out valleys. Glaciers also move sediment from one location to another, which helps to shape the land. Additionally, tectonic plate shifts can cause landmasses to move, which can further alter the landscape. Together, glaciers and tectonic plate shifts can create dramatic changes in the landscape.",C3

B:
The water cycle is a cycle of continuous movement of water on the Earth. During the water cycle, evaporation creates water vapor from the oceans, lakes and rivers. This vapor then rises and condenses to form clouds. The clouds then release precipitation such as rain and snow, which returns water to the surface of the Earth. The runoff carries the water into streams and rivers, which will eventually return to the oceans and start the cycle again.

C1:
 The carbon cycle is a process in which carbon is cycled through the environment. Through photosynthesis, plants return carbon from the atmosphere to the environment. During respiration, carbon dioxide is created from the breakdown of organic compounds. Decomposition carries carbon from dead organisms and waste back into the environment.

C2:
Seeds are sown into the ground.
The earth where the seeds are planted is given water and fertilizer.
The seeds start to grow and become seedlings.
The plants are given water.
The seedlings grow into plants.
Weeds growing near the plants are removed.

B:
A volcano erupts when magma builds up pressure beneath the surface.
  The pressure causes the magma to force its way up through the volcano, releasing heat in the process.
  The combination of pressure and heat leads to the eruption of the volcano.

C1:
 Tension builds up between tectonic plates. Seismic waves are detected by seismographs before they are even released. As tension reaches a certain level, plates are forced past one another, releasing seismic waves. Then, an earthquake occurs. Finally, the seismic waves travel through the Earth.

C2:
An earthquake is caused by the tension that builds up between tectonic plates.
  When the tension reaches a certain level, the plates are forced past one another, releasing seismic waves and causing an earthquake.
  The seismic waves travel through the Earth and can be detected by seismographs.

C3:
Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily.
Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant.
The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis.
The glucose travels the plant.
The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow.

C4:
Plants start growing on or near the rocks.
The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock.
The plant acids dissolve the rock.
The rock is broken down into smaller pieces.
Erosion begins.",ANSWER: C2

B:
Caverns are formed when erosion carves rock.
  The erosive forces of wind, water, and ice can wear away at solid rock to create a cave.
  The cave is then further sculpted by the process of dissolution, which is when water dissolves the rock and creates a chamber.
  Sediment can also fill in a chamber, further adding to the formation of a cavern.

C1:
 The process of permeation carves out spaces in the sediment. Then, water fills the aquifer, creating an underground water source. Afterward, infiltration of water occurs, creating an aquifer. Finally, an underground reservoir is formed.

C2:
Fuel mixes with air.
Mix gets inducted into cylinder.
Piston compresses the mix.
Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion.
Combustion gases expand.
Pushes piston during power stroke.
Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe.

C3:
Underground aquifers form through the process of permeation.
  The process of permeation carves out spaces in the sediment, allowing infiltration of water.
  This infiltration creates an aquifer, which is a type of underground reservoir.
  The water then fills the aquifer creating an underground water source.

C4:
He air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases.
Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body.
At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide.
Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the blood stream and then exhaled.
Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange.",ANSWER: C3

Your goal is to find the one out of four paragraphs (C1, C2, C3, C4) that describes an analogous process.
Remember, only one paragraph is the correct match.
You must carefully read and compare each to find the correct analogous process.
Analogy is a mapping between entities in two domains base and target, that relies on relational similarity, rather than object attributes.
For example, for a base paragraph about ""How does an electrical circuit work?"", and a target paragraph about ""How does a mechanical water pump work?"", there exists an analogy.
Similar relations are:
""battery generates electrical voltage"", similarly to ""pump produces pressure"".
""electrons move through copper wire"", similarly to ""water flows pipe"".
""resistor decrease voltage rate"", similarly to ""valve reduce flow rate"".
Note that ""battery"" : ""pump"", ""electrons"" : ""water"", ""copper wire"" : ""pipe"" and ""resistor"" : ""valve"",
all are pair of entities one in the base and the other in target, that plays a similar role in the paragraphs.
Respond with ""ANSWER: "" and then ""C1"" or ""C2"" or ""C3"" or ""C4"" for the option that describes the best analogous process to the process in 'B'.
