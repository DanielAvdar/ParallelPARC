The tubules within the nephrons then absorb the necessary nutrients from the filtered blood. The renal artery supplies the kidneys with the blood that needs to be filtered, while the renal vein transports the waste away from the kidneys.", "target_paragraph": "A mechanical system of water pump uses a pump to filter the water. The filter helps to remove any impurities from the water. The pipes absorb certain minerals from the water as it passes through. The inlet pipe supplies the water to the pump and the outlet pipe transports the filtered water away from the pump. The pump ensures that the water is filtered and free of impurities before it is transported to its destination.", "ground_truth": "1"}
