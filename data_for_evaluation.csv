The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler.
The coal and hot air burn over a fire.
Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler.
The water turns into steam.
The steam presses against turbines.
The turbines spin.
Electricity is produced.","The human body takes a breath inward.
Air is transported to the lungs.
Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs.
In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries.
The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood.
The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells.
The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme.
Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues.
Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen.
The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue.","You eat food.
Your stomach digests the food.
Sugars from food enter your bloodstream.
Insulin helps turn sugars into energy.
Insulin helps your body store the energy in fat, muscle and liver cells.","Erosion is the process of gradual destruction of the surface of the earth. Water wears away surface rocks, rain breaks down minerals, and waves wash away particles. All of these elements combine to wear away the surface of the earth over time as they are moved by water, wind, and ice. The result is a gradual reshaping of the land.","[""Coal is mined out of the ground.\nCoal is pulverized into fine powder.\nThe coal is mixed with hot air.\nThe coal and hot air are blown into a boiler.\nThe coal and hot air burn over a fire.\nHighly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler.\nThe water turns into steam.\nThe steam presses against turbines.\nThe turbines spin.\nElectricity is produced."", ""You eat food.\nYour stomach digests the food.\nSugars from food enter your bloodstream.\nInsulin helps turn sugars into energy.\nInsulin helps your body store the energy in fat, muscle and liver cells."", ""The human body takes a breath inward.\nAir is transported to the lungs.\nAir reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs.\nIn the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries.\nThe gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood.\nThe dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells.\nThe red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme.\nRed blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues.\nWithin small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen.\nThe oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue."", ""Erosion is the process of gradual destruction of the surface of the earth.

309,637Describe the life cycle of a human,"The life cycle of a bird begins when a bird hatches from an egg. The young bird then grows its feathers and learns to fly. As it matures, the bird reproduces and produces offspring. In order to survive, the bird may also migrate for food.","Baby rabbits are born alive.
Rabbits are (only occasionally) nursed by their mothers.
Many of the babies do not survive.
Larger and stronger rabbit do manage to survive.
Rabbits quickly become able to have babies of their own.
The rabbit lifecycle continues.
The amount of rabbits stays reasonable because of predators and low survival rates for their young.","A mold spore floats through the air.
The spore lands on a piece of bread.
The spore grows hyphae into the bread.
The mold forms a colony.
Sporangiophores grow upward.
The mold sends out spores.","The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat.
Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate.
Over a period of days, the animal's heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly.
Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active.
The animal has entered hibernation mode.","Humans are born from their mother. As they grow up, they develop physical traits and grow into adults. Through learning, they acquire language and skills, and when they reach maturity, they can reproduce and have children. In some cases, humans migrate to different parts of the world to search for better opportunities.","[""A mold spore floats through the air.\nThe spore lands on a piece of bread.\nThe spore grows hyphae into the bread.\nThe mold forms a colony.\nSporangiophores grow upward.\nThe mold sends out spores."", ""Humans are born from their mother.
