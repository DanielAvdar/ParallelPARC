307,1144Describe how deforestation can negatively affect animals,"Forest fires can have a huge negative impact on the animals that inhabit the area. Fire destroys vegetation, reducing the food sources for animals and leading to displacement. Smoke from the fire reduces the oxygen levels in the area, making it difficult for animals to breathe. Additionally, the extreme heat caused by the fire can disrupt the behavior and habitats of animals, making it difficult for them to survive.","Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock.
The wind or water deposits tiny rocks.
The rocks become known as sediment.
The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top.
Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve.

308,950What happens during erosion?,Weathering is the process of breaking down surface rocks into smaller particles. Wind is an example of mechanical weathering where it wears away the surface rocks. Sunlight is an example of chemical weathering where it breaks down minerals. Rain is an example of hydrologic weathering where it washes away particles.,"Skin is cut or damaged.

The bacteria reproduces and spreads.
Causes symptoms.
The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease.","A radioisotope has unstable nuclei that does not have enough binding energy to hold the nucleus together.
Radioisotopes would like to be stable isotopes so they are constantly changing to try and stabilize.
In the process, they will release energy and matter from their nucleus and often transform into a new element.
This process, called transmutation, is the change of one element into another as a result of changes within the nucleus.
He radioactive decay and transmutation process will continue until a new element is formed that has a stable nucleus and is not radioactive."," Erosion, the process of gradual destruction of the earth's surface, begins. Over time, the surface of the earth is worn away. Following this, water wears away surface rocks. Then, rain breaks down minerals. Waves also wash away particles.
